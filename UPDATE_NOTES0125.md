## Updates Summary

### Date: January 25, 2026

This update introduces new node label names for improved clarity and consistency across the calculus concept map, and adds a new Mermaid diagram source file to the repository.

---

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `graph_data.json` - Updated node labels throughout the graph structure
- `README.md` - Added reference to the new Mermaid diagram file

### Files Added

- `All_Computer_Science_Topics_Update.mmd` - New Mermaid diagram source file with updated node labels and structure

### Changes Made

#### 1. New Node Label Names

Updated node labels in the graph data to provide clearer and more descriptive names for calculus topics. The new labels improve readability and maintain consistency with the topic naming scheme defined in `Calculus topic labeling scheme.csv`.

**Examples of updated node labels:**
- Node labels have been standardized to match the official topic names
- Improved clarity in node descriptions for better user understanding
- Enhanced consistency between graph nodes and CSV topic definitions

#### 2. New Mermaid Diagram Document

Added `All_Computer_Science_Topics_Update.mmd` as an updated source file for the CS topic map visualization. This file:

- Contains the updated node label names
- Maintains the hierarchical structure of calculus topics
- Provides a visual representation of the topic relationships
- Can be used to generate updated graph visualizations

**Document Links:**
- Original source file: `All_Computer_Science_Topics (3).mmd`
- Updated source file: `All_Computer_Science_Topics_Update.mmd`

The new Mermaid diagram file serves as an additional reference for understanding the structure and relationships between calculus topics and their connections to computer science applications.

---

## Verification

The following verification steps were performed:

1. **Node Label Consistency**: Verified that all node labels in `graph_data.json` match the updated naming conventions
2. **Mermaid File Validation**: Confirmed that `All_Computer_Science_Topics_Update.mmd` contains valid Mermaid syntax and can be rendered correctly
3. **Graph Visualization**: Tested that the updated node labels display correctly in the interactive visualization
4. **Documentation Links**: Verified that references to the new Mermaid file are correctly included in project documentation

---

## Impact

These updates provide the following benefits:

1. **Improved Clarity**: New node label names make it easier for users to understand the calculus topics being represented
2. **Better Documentation**: The additional Mermaid diagram file provides an updated visual reference for the project structure
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Having both original and updated Mermaid files allows for comparison and tracking of changes over time
4. **Consistency**: Standardized node labels ensure alignment between the graph data and topic definitions
