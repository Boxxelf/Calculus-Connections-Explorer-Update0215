# Calculus Connections Explorer — Mechanical Engineering (placeholder)

This folder is the **Mechanical Engineering** placeholder site. It uses the same calculus concept map as the main (CS) site, with ME courses and topics from `ME topic lists.csv` (Dynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer). Connections and rationales are not yet filled in; all rationales are empty and the UI shows placeholder messages.

- **Local:** open `index.html` from this folder, or serve the repo root and go to `/meche/`.
- **GitHub Pages:**  
  https://boxxelf.github.io/Calculus-Connections-Explorer-Update0215/meche/

Once connections and rationales are ready, update `graph_data_meche.json` (add entries under `rationales` for each ME course) and the same UI will show real content.
